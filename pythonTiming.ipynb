    "## Measuring Execution Time of Operations in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Below code block demonstrates how to use the `Timer` utility class to measure the time taken for a large number of simple operations in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- A `Timer` object is created.\n",
    "- For each value of `i` from 4 to 8:\n",
    "  - The timer is started.\n",
    "  - A loop runs `10**i` times, incrementing a variable `n` by `i` in each iteration.\n",
    "  - The timer is stopped.\n",
    "  - The iteration count, elapsed time, and result are printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment shows how execution time increases as the number of operations grows exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical Time Complexity and Python's Speed:**\n",
    "- The inner loop runs in **O(N)** time, where `N = 10**i`.\n",
    "- For simple arithmetic operations, Python can perform approximately **10⁷ (10 million) operations per second** on modern hardware.\n",
    "- The actual number may vary depending on the system and the complexity of the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This block helps you estimate how many operations Python can handle per second and is useful for benchmarking"
